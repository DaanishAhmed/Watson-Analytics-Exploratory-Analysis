Exploratory Data Analysis on Employee Attrition Data
----------------

This project involves the use of Watson Analytics to analyze a dataset containing employee attrition information.  My goal is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the trends and relationships between variables in the data.  I do this by creating visualizations and dashboards that explore the connections between important variables.  The results should offer some insights regarding the causes of employee attrition.

The full report can be found in the file "Attrition EDA.pdf".  This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data refinement, results, and proposed solutions.  Tables and visualizations are included in the appendix.

The dataset is located in the file "employee attrition.xlsx".  It has been cleaned of outliers, missing values, and errors. The original file was obtained from IBM's list of sample datasets:
